##################### Grafana Configuration for grafanactl Testing #####################
#
# This is a minimal Grafana configuration file for testing grafanactl against a local
# Grafana instance running in Docker. Most configuration is handled via environment
# variables in docker-compose.yml, but this file can be used for additional customization.
#

[paths]
# Path to where grafana stores plugins
;plugins = /var/lib/grafana/plugins
# Path to where grafana stores temporary files
;temp_data_lifetime = 24h

[server]
# Protocol (http, https, h2, socket)
protocol = http
# The http port to use
http_port = 3000
# The public facing domain name used to access grafana from a browser
domain = localhost
# Redirect to correct domain if host header does not match domain
enforce_domain = false
# The full public facing url
root_url = %(protocol)s://%(domain)s:%(http_port)s/

[database]
# You can configure the database connection in docker-compose.yml via environment variables
# or you can configure it here. Environment variables take precedence.
# Database connection is already configured via environment variables in docker-compose.yml

[security]
# Default admin user and password (configured via environment variables in docker-compose.yml)
# admin_user = admin
# admin_password = admin

[users]
# Default theme (light, dark, or system)
default_theme = dark
# Allow users to sign up for an account
allow_sign_up = false
# Allow org admins to invite users
allow_org_create = false

[auth.anonymous]
# Enable anonymous access
enabled = false

[analytics]
# Disable reporting
reporting_enabled = false
check_for_updates = false

[feature_toggles]
# Enable the kubernetesDashboards feature for grafanactl
# This is required for grafanactl's resources commands to work properly
enable = kubernetesDashboards

[log]
# Either "console", "file", "syslog". Default is console and file
mode = console
# Either "debug", "info", "warn", "error", "critical", default is "info"
level = info

[log.console]
# log line format, valid options are text, console and json
format = console
