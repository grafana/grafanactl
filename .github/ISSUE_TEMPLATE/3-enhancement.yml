        The `grafanactl resources push` command currently processes all resources sequentially.
        When pushing 50+ dashboards, it takes several minutes to complete.
        There's a --max-concurrent flag, but it doesn't seem to have much effect...

      placeholder: |
        The push command should better utilize concurrency. Maybe:
        - Increase default --max-concurrent value
        - Add progress indicators showing which resources are being processed
        - Batch smaller resources together for more efficient uploads
        - Add a --fast flag that optimizes for speed over caution

        This would reduce our CI/CD deployment time from 5 minutes to under 1 minute.
        We're pushing 80 dashboards on every deploy, and the sequential processing
        creates a bottleneck in our release pipeline. Faster deploys mean faster
        iteration and quicker rollbacks when needed.

        Example command that's slow:
        $ grafanactl resources push ./dashboards/ --context=prod

        Current behavior: Takes ~5 minutes for 80 dashboards
        Desired behavior: Should complete in under 1 minute

        Similar tools like kubectl can push hundreds of resources quickly.

      description: Should the old way still work?
      options:
        - No, it's purely additive (new flag/option)
        - Yes, but the old way should still work (default behavior change)
        - Yes, and I think that's okay (breaking change)
        - I'm not sure
