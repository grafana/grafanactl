# Grafana CLI

> [!NOTE]
> **Grafana CLI only supports *Grafana 12 and above*, older Grafana versions are not supported!**

Grafana CLI (_grafanactl_) is a command-line tool designed to simplify interaction with Grafana instances.

It enables users to authenticate, manage multiple environments, and perform administrative tasks through Grafana's REST API â€” all from the terminal.

Whether you're automating workflows in CI/CD pipelines or switching between staging and production environments, Grafana CLI provides a flexible and scriptable way to manage your Grafana setup efficiently.
